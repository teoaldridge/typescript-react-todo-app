I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

In this project I practiced and learned: 
(in basics.ts)
- Typescript's Base Types
- Working with Array and Object Types
- Understanding Type Inference
- Using Union Types
- Understanding Type Aliases
- Functions and Function Types
- Generics
(the rest of the project)
- creating a React+ TypeScript project
- working with Components and typescript
- Adding data Model
- Form Submission in Typescript Projects
- Working with refs and useref
- working with 'Function props'
- Managing State & Typescript


To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74827533/167822228-edcbc8ba-3dd4-4166-8e52-c3efdb389a21.png)
